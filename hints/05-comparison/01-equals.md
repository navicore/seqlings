# Hint: Equality (=)

The `=` operator checks if two values are equal.

## Solution

```seq
42 42 =
```

This pushes 42, pushes another 42, then compares them. Result: `true`.

## Equality as Abstraction

Equality testing is a form of abstraction - you're asking "are these the same?" without caring about what they actually are. This question applies to any comparable values.
