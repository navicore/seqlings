# Hint: Not Equal (<>)

`<>` is the negation of `=`.

## Solution

```seq
100 99 <>
```

100 does not equal 99, so the result is `true`.

## The <> Symbol

The `<>` notation comes from mathematics and older programming languages. Think of it as "less than OR greater than" - if either is true, the values aren't equal.
