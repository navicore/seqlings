# Hint: Not Equal (<>)

`i.<>` is the negation of `i.=`.

## Solution

```seq
100 99 <>
```

100 does not equal 99, so the result is `true`.

## The <> Symbol

The `i.<>` notation comes from mathematics and older programming languages. Think of it as "less than OR greater than" - if either is true, the values aren't equal.
