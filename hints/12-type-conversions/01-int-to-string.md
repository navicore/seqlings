# Hint: Integer to String

The `int->string` function converts any integer to its string representation.

## Solution

```seq
2024 int->string
```

The number `2024` is pushed onto the stack, then `int->string` pops it and pushes the string `"2024"`.

## Why This Matters

String conversion is essential for:
- Building user-facing messages
- Logging and debugging
- File I/O operations
- Concatenating numbers with text
