# Hint: Comments

This exercise teaches you Seq's comment syntax.

## Comment Syntax in Seq

Seq uses `#` for comments, not `//`:

```seq
# This is a correct comment
// This is NOT a valid comment in Seq
```

## The Fix

Find the line with `//` and change it to `#`.

## Why `#`?

Seq follows the tradition of shell scripts and many other languages that use `#` for line comments. This makes it easy to write shell scripts that include Seq code.
