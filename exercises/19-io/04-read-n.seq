# Exercise: Reading Fixed Bytes
#
# `io.read-n` reads exactly n bytes from input.
#
# Stack effect: ( n -- String )
#
# This is useful for binary protocols or fixed-format data.
#
# Example:
#   4 io.read-n   # Read exactly 4 bytes
#
# Your task: Understand fixed-size reads.
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE

: test-read-n ( -- )
    # Can't test without actual input
    true test.assert
;
