# Exercise: Float Literals
#
# Float literals in Seq must contain a decimal point.
#
# Examples:
#   3.14      # A float
#   42.0      # Also a float (the .0 matters!)
#   42        # This is an integer, NOT a float
#
# Your task: Push the float 2.5 onto the stack.
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE

: test-float-literals ( -- )
    # Your code here - push 2.5
    0.0
    # Do not edit below this line
    2.5 f.= test.assert
