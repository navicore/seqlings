# Exercise: Not Equal (<>)
#
# The `<>` operator tests if two integers are NOT equal.
#
# Stack effect: ( a b -- bool )
#
# Example:
#   5 3 <>    # true (5 is not equal to 3)
#   5 5 <>    # false (5 equals 5)
#
# Your task: Check if 100 is not equal to 99.
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE

: test-not-equal ( -- )
    # Your code here - is 100 <> 99?
    false
    # Do not edit below this line
    test.assert
