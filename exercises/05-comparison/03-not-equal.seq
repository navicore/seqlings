# Exercise: Not Equal (i.<>)
#
# The `i.<>` operator tests if two integers are NOT equal.
# (Word form `i.neq` also works.)
#
# Stack effect: ( a b -- bool )
#
# Example:
#   5 3 i.<>    # true (5 is not equal to 3)
#   5 5 i.<>    # false (5 equals 5)
#
# Your task: Check if 100 is not equal to 99.
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE

: test-not-equal ( -- )
    # Your code here - is 100 i.<> 99?
    false
    # Do not edit below this line
    test.assert
