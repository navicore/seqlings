# Exercise: Equality (i.=)
#
# The `i.=` operator tests if two integers are equal.
# (You can also write `i.eq` - both forms work.)
#
# Stack effect: ( a b -- bool )
#
# Example:
#   5 5 i.=    # true
#   5 3 i.=    # false
#
# Your task: Check if 42 equals 42.
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE

: test-equals ( -- )
    # Your code here - compare 42 to 42
    false
    # Do not edit below this line
    test.assert
