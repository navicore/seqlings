# Exercise: String Concatenation
#
# `string.concat` joins two strings together.
#
# Stack effect: ( str1 str2 -- combined )

# Example:
#   "Hello, " "World!" string.concat   # "Hello, World!"
#
# Your task: Concatenate "Seq" and "lings" to get "Seqlings".
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE

: test-concat ( -- )
    # Your code here
    ""
    # Do not edit below this line
    "Seqlings" string.equal? test.assert
;
