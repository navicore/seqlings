# Exercise: 3drop
#
# The `3drop` word removes the top three elements from the stack.
#
# Stack effect: ( a b c -- )
#
# Useful for cleaning up after operations that leave unwanted values.
#
# Example:
#   1 2 3 4 5 3drop    # Stack: ( 1 2 )
#
# Your task: Use `3drop` to remove the garbage, leaving just 42.
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE
