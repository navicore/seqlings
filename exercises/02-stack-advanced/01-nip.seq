# Exercise: nip
#
# The `nip` word removes the second element from the stack,
# keeping only the top element.
#
# Stack effect: ( a b -- b )
#
# It's equivalent to: swap drop
#
# Example:
#   1 2 nip    # Stack: ( 2 ) - the 1 is gone
#
# Your task: Use `nip` to remove the 100, keeping only 42.
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE

: test-nip ( -- )
    100 42
    # Your code here - add nip
    # Do not edit below this line
    42 test.assert-eq
