# Exercise: list.fold - Reduce to Single Value
#
# `list.fold` combines all elements into one value.
# Also known as "reduce" in other languages.
#
# Stack effect: ( list initial quot -- result )
#
# Example:
#   [ 1 2 3 ] 0 [ i.add ] list.fold   # 6 (0+1+2+3)
#   [ 1 2 3 ] 1 [ i.multiply ] list.fold  # 6 (1*1*2*3)
#
# HIGHER-ORDER PATTERN:
# fold is the most general list operation. You can implement
# map and filter in terms of fold! It takes:
#   - An initial accumulator value
#   - A quotation that combines accumulator with each element
#
# Your task: Sum all numbers in a list.
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE

: sum-list ( List -- Int )
    # Your code here - use list.fold
    drop 0
;

: test-fold ( -- )
    [ 10 20 30 40 ] sum-list
    # Do not edit below this line
    100 test.assert-eq
