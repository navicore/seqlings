# Exercise: list.fold - Reduce to Single Value
#
# `list.fold` combines all elements into one value.
# Also known as "reduce" in other languages.
#
# Stack effect: ( Variant initial Quotation -- result )
#
# Example:
#   "apple banana cherry" " " string.split "" [ string.concat ] list.fold
#   # Result: "applebananacherry"
#
# HIGHER-ORDER PATTERN:
# fold is the most general list operation. You can implement
# map and filter in terms of fold! It takes:
#   - An initial accumulator value
#   - A quotation that combines accumulator with each element
#
# Your task: Concatenate all words with dashes between them.
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE

: join-with-dash ( Variant -- String )
    # Your code here - use list.fold
    # Hint: Start with "" and use a quotation that adds "-" between words
    # One approach: fold with [ swap dup string.empty? if drop else "-" string.concat then swap string.concat ]
    drop ""
;

: test-fold ( -- )
    "one two three" " " string.split join-with-dash
    # Do not edit below this line
    "one-two-three" string.equal? test.assert
