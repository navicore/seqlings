# Exercise: Numbers
#
# Seq supports integers and floats. Writing a number pushes it onto the stack.
#
# Stack effects are written as: ( inputs -- outputs )
# For example, ( -- Int ) means "takes nothing, leaves an Int on the stack"
#
# Your task: Return 42 (the answer to life, the universe, and everything).
# When done, delete the marker line below.

# I AM NOT DONE

: answer ( -- Int )
    0
;

# Do not edit below this line

: test-answer ( -- )
    answer 42 test.assert-eq
