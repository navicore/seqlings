# Exercise: Comments
#
# Comments in Seq start with a # character and continue to the end of the line.
# They help document your code for others (and your future self!).
#
# Your task: Fix the broken comment on the line marked TODO.
# The comment syntax is incorrect - can you spot the problem?
#
# Remove the "# NOT DONE" marker when complete.

# NOT DONE

: main ( -- )
    // TODO: This comment uses the wrong syntax! Fix it.
    "Comments work!" io.write-line
